                <p>
                  Testing is an exhaustive process especially for projects which
                  have frequent changes in the code. Regression tests for such
                  products done manually may become tedious and less cost
                  effective. Allocating testing resources wisely can make huge
                  progress in bringing efficacy to the testing process. The key
                  is to assign valuable human resources for assessing the
                  process while devising specialized automated testing processes
                  for test phases requiring frequent reruns. The time and effort
                  spent in automating test processes pay off in the long run by
                  saving effort, time, and cost by manifolds.

                  During this phase we carry out a thorough requirements and
                  application review. By understanding the application and the
                  requirements of the project, we outline the key requirements
                  of automating the application testing. Moreover, we also
                  conduct a detailed analysis of the projectâ€™s scope and

                <p>
                  In the second phase, we prepare test cases for the application
                  as per the requirements specification document. Purpose of
                  preparing test cases is to ensure complete test coverage of

                  document.

                <h2>Test Scripts Development</h2>
                <p>
                  Once test cases are prepared and the test <b>automation</b>{" "}
                  team knows what has to be automated, we setup the test
                  environment and start scripting the manual test cases. We
                  prepare an <b>automation</b> framework according to the
                  analysis from the first phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <b>automation</b> frameworks can be data driven, keyword
                  driven or hybrid. The key is to select a framework that
                  ensures maintainable and scalable script development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another important consideration in selecting a framework is
                  its reporting mechanism. Typically, a framework provides
                  complete test results details for debugging issues and a
                  summary of the test results for non-technical viewers. After
                  the framework is in place, <b>automation</b> of the manual
                  test cases begins. We document any deviations from the manual
                  test cases for future reference and for helping in preparing
                  testing scope for test cycles

                  the application. Then we analyze the test reports generated
