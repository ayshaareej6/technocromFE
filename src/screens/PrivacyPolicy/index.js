                  We may collect your personal data that you provide to us, for
                  example, when you contact us electronically or respond to our
                  email. We may collect your business contact details when you
                  exchange business cards with our representatives at meetings
                  and events, or when you provide your contacts to sign up for
                  our events.

                <p>
                  When submitting your request/inquiry on our websites, you may
                  be asked for information such as, but not limited to, your

                  When contacting us through live chats on our websites, you may
                  be asked for information such as, but not limited to, your
                  name and email address. This is needed when we are not ready
                  to answer you immediately and need more time to handle your
                  request. When you give us your personal data in live chat, we
                  assume that you consent to processing it by Technocrom.

                <h2>Who may access your personal data</h2>
                <p>
                  We may disclose your personal data to (1) our employees who
                  are in contact with you or who are responsible for marketing,
                  (2) our affiliated companies, (3) third-party service
                  providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Statistical data about our websites’ visitors may be accessed
                  by (1) our employees in marketing and/or IT departments who
                  are responsible for analyzing such data and for improving our
                  websites, (2) our affiliated companies (some of them are
                  located outside the European Union), (3) third-party service
                  providers.
                </p>

                <h2>Transfers to third countries</h2>
                <p>
                  We are a multinational group of companies. For this reason,
                  your personal data may be transferred to and stored outside
                  the country where you are located. This includes countries
                  outside the European Economic Area with no adequate level of
                  personal data protection (third countries).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As some of the countries where our offices are situated are
                  not yet recognized by the European Commission as countries
                  with an adequate level of personal data protection, these
                  offices have access to personal data on the basis of
                  instruments that cover the European Union requirements for the
                  transfer of personal data to data controllers/processors
                  outside the European Union (Standard Contractual Clauses
                  approved by the European Commission). You may ask us to
                  inspect copies of these clauses by contacting our data
                  protection officer.
                </p>
                <h2>Third-party providers</h2>
                <p>
                  When we transfer personal data, we do so for the purposes for
                  which the information has been collected/submitted, for the
                  purposes listed above, for the administration and maintenance
                  of our websites and associated systems, and/or other internal
                  or administrative purposes. We also may transfer personal data
                  to third parties providing identity management, website
                  hosting and management, data analysis, data backup, security
                  and storage services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We work only with those third-party providers that are bound
                  to maintain appropriate levels of security and
                  confidentiality, to process personal data only as instructed
                  by us and to flow those same obligations down to their
                  sub-processors.
                </p>
                <h2>Retention of your personal data</h2>
                <p>
                  We will retain your personal information in our systems only
                  for as long as we need it, given the purposes for which it was
                  collected, or as required to do so by law.
                </p>

                <h2>Rights in relation to your personal data</h2>
                <p>
                  Under your local laws and the European Union legislation, you
                  may exercise the following rights by submitting your
                  request/inquiry on our websites:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>right to require access to your personal data,</li>
                  <li>right to require rectification of your personal data,</li>
                  <li>right to require erasure of your personal data,</li>
                  <li>
                    right to withdraw your consent regarding processing of your
                    personal data.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In some cases, you may also have a right (1) to request
                  restriction on processing of your personal data or (2) to
                  object to processing of your personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are cases when we can retain copies of the personal data
                  you requested us to erase. They concern the necessity to
                  protect legitimate interests of Technocrom or third parties,
                  comply with governmental orders, resolve disputes,
                  troubleshoot problems, or enforce any agreement you have
                  formed with us.
                </p>

                <h2>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h2>
                <p>
                  You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data
                  protection regulator if you think your privacy rights have
                  been violated.
