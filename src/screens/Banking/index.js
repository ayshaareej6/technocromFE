                  To be effective in the banking sector, QA teams need to have a
                  deep understanding of the banking industry and the specific
                  systems and processes used by their organization. They should
                  also be familiar with relevant regulations and standards, and
                  be able to work closely with other teams, such as IT and
                  compliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most effective ways to ensure that QA is effective
                  in the banking sector is to have a robust test management
                  system in place that allows teams to plan, execute, track and
                  report on their testing activities. This can help ensure that
                  all testing is thorough, repeatable, and consistent, and that
                  any issues are identified and resolved quickly.
